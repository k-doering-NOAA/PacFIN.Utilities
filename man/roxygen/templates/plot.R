#' @param plot Argument takes either a logical or character value specifying the file
#'   name if you want to write the plots to a disk rather than printing them
#'   to the console. If \code{plot = FALSE} no plots will be generated.
#'   If printing to the disk the character value should end in \code{.png}
#'   as \code{png()} is used to save the plotting device.
