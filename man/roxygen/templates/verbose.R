#' @param verbose A logical specifying if output should be written to the
#'   screen or not. Good for testing and exploring your data but can be turned
#'   off when output indicates information that you already know. The printing
#'   of output to the screen does not affect any of the returned objects. The
#'   default is to always print to the screen, i.e., `verbose = TRUE`.
